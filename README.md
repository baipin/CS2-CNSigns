> a Mod based on Write Everywhere of Cities:skylines2.

### Outstanding Features
* Covering various kinds of traffic signs in Chinese Mainland.
* Strictly made according to China National Standard GB_5768.2-2022.  
* **Very convenient to use.** The template is already there, and you just need to change the texts.

## Important: No Chinese font pre-existed, you need to import by yourself...重要：本模组不含预装中文模组，请根据以下步骤自行下载导入：
Due to the copyright issue, please download Chinese font and import by yourself.  
出于版权原因（因为中国路牌的中文字体为标准黑体，我并未找到比较适合的免费开放字体），请自行下载导入中文字体。  
* Copy the .ttf file to C:\Users\\[Your username]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\\.Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts, if no "fonts"dictionary, please create one.
* Enter your savegame.
* Click the Write Everywhere buttom on the left-top (A circled "W").
* Choose "CITY FONTS" tab.
* Click "+", select your ttf file, click "OK".
* You are done!

## Recommended structures 推荐路牌架
For overhead direction signs, you can use one or both of the following assets:
* [Highway Sign Frame Pack](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/127597/Any) by me. 由我制作的  
* [Highway Sign Structures](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/127499/Any) by lolok. 由 lolok制作的
  
There might be some differences for pre-layouts, but you can simply adjust manually.  
这两个路牌架可能对于模组的预制布局表现略有不同（可能刚好反过来等等），但是你可以简单地手动调整。我是根据我制作的路牌架制作该模组的预制布局的。
