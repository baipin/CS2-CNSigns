  <ShortDescription Value="China Signs Pack based on Write Everywhere" />
  <LongDescription># The module is under debelopment, but you can subscribe to take an early look!

### Outstanding Features
* Covering various kinds of traffic signs in Chinese Mainland.
* **Very convenient to use.** The template is already there, and you just need to change the texts.

## Important: No Chinese font pre-existed, you need to import by yourself...
Due to the copyright issue, please download Chinese font and import by yourself.  
* Copy the .ttf file to C:\Users\[Your username]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\.Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts, if no "fonts"dictionary, please create one.
* Enter your savegame.
* Click the Write Everywhere buttom on the left-top (A circled "W").
* Choose "CITY FONTS" tab.
* Click "+", select your ttf file, click "OK".
* You are done!

## Recommended structures
For overhead direction signs, you can use one or both of the following assets:
* [Highway Sign Frame Pack](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/127597/Any) by me.
* [Highway Sign Structures](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/127499/Any) by lolok.
  
There might be some differences for pre-layouts, but you can simply adjust manually.
